 ## Project Details and Credits
 
 - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 - This is a study project using the 'Active Learning and Creative Code Reinvention' techniques based on [briancodex/react-website-v1](https://github.com/briancodex/react-website-v1/tree/master). This means, I am actively engaging with the codebase, not by simply cloning or copying it, but by thoroughly understanding and rewriting it. My primary objective is to cement my learning through practice, and applying concepts studied.
 - The 'Creative Reinvention' method of study might result in code changes such as class names and menu labels, among others.

## Most Significant Applied Concepts

(In progress)
- distinction between named exports, requiring a specific import syntax, and default exports, allowing for a different import approach in React;
- reviewed benefits of using 'link' tag instead of 'a' tag
